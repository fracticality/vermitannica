               rewritten and will soon be joined by others.

               Vermitannica provides an in-game method of viewing the models, attributes, statistics, and more
               for the enemies, careers, and weapons in the game.
               Open with /vermitannica or set a keybind using VMF's Mod Options (F4 by default).
               Additionally, keybinds can be set to jump straight to a module within Vermitannica, such as Bestiary.
